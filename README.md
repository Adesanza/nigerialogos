## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Instruction

* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Run `npm run build` to build/generate the css files
* Optionally `npm run scss` to watch the css files
* Finally, open the [index.html](https://github.com/PaystackHQ/nigerialogos/blob/master/index.html) file in your browser to view the site 

### NOTE 
For **Chrome Browser**, you will need to allow "XMLHttpRequest" to access files from other files using `--allow-file-access-from-files`

**Windows Users:** `Chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files` <br />
To confirm you have it set correctly, go to **chrome://version/** in a new chrome browser window you should see "**--allow-file-access-from-files**" listed within the **Command Line** section on the page. If not found, follow the steps below to have get it set:

- Exit your Chrome browser if running (close all instances if you have multiple windows open).
- Open a command prompt window.
- Run `Chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files` from the cli. If chrome.exe is not recognized follow the immediate 3 steps below:<br />

> - From the cli, navigate to where your **chrome.exe** file is located: eg `cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application"`. <br />
> - Use the command `dir` to ascertain chrome.exe resides in the directory. 
> - Run `Chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files` from the cli again.

- A new chrome browser window will start up, you may check **Command line** section on the **chrome://version/** page again if correctly set. However, the index.html file should now work with full functionalities. 

**Mac Users:** `open /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/ --args --allow-file-access-from-files`
